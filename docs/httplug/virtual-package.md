# Composer Virtual Packages

Virtual packages are a way to specify the dependency on an implementation of an interface-only repository
without forcing a specific implementation. For HTTPlug, the virtual package is called `php-http/client-implementation`.

There is no project registered with that name. However, all client implementations including client adapters for
HTTPlug use the `provide` section to tell composer that they do provide the client-implementation.


# Using a Library that depends on HTTPlug

Reusable libraries do not depend on a concrete implementation but only on the virtual package
`php-http/client-implementation`. This is to avoid hard coupling and allows the user of the
library to choose the implementation. You can think of this as an "interface" or "contract" for packages.

When *using a reusable library* in an application, one must `require` a concrete implementation.
Make sure the `require` section includes a
[package that provides php-http/client-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/client-implementation).
Failing to do that will lead to composer reporting this error:

``` bash
$ composer update
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - The requested package php-http/client-implementation could not be found in any version,
    there may be a typo in the package name.
```

Doing something like the following will make this problem go away:

``` bash
$ composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

Pick a client based on your personal preferences or dependencies of your project.
If your preferred client has no HTTPlug adapter, submit one.

The client will in turn depend on `php-http/httplug`, thus you do not need to duplicate the
dependency on `php-http/httplug` in your composer.json file.
However, if your code depends on a minimal version of HTTPlug,
specify it to have composer report problems rather than the application failing at some point.


# Building a Reusable Library

When *writing a reusable library*, the `require` section should only mention `php-http/client-implementation`,
while the `require-dev` section needs to specify a concrete implementation in most cases,
in order for the package to be installable on its own for development and testing.
